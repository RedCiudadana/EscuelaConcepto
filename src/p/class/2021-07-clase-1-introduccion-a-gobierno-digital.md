## **Introducción**

Intended for those interested in public policy and service delivery, this course provides a broad overview of emerging opportunities, challenges and risks created by information technology in the public sector. The course will be particularly concerned with how information technology increases the feedback loop - and thus the speed - at which bureaucracies can learn and adapt. The course will provide an introduction to core concepts in the digital space and then explore the opportunities and challenges around the use of data analytics, security and privacy concerns, agile and iterative policy and program development, and design thinking. The course will also look how technology is already and could continue to shape the structure and functions of government.

Digital technologies matter because our society, our economy, and our organizations have — for better and worse — become digitized. If policy makers and public servants can’t understand what this means, how it alters the production of public goods, or its impact on management, regulation, the economy, and policy, we are in trouble.

The first involves a fairly straight forward implication of Andreessen’s analysis. An alternative reading of Andreessen’s op-ed title is “How digital is eating the physical.” **It is the digital sphere — and the rules, norms and structures that come to define it—that will, in many cases, control the physical sphere**. This is why digital’s impact on the economy, democracy, and society should not be underestimated. It is also why understanding, shaping and engaging in those rules, norms and structures is essential to a policy school. Those interested in the public sphere will need frameworks and tools to address questions of ethics in digital technologies, to say nothing of its impact on equity, the public good, safety, privacy and innumerable other issues.
